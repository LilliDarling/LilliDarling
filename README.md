- 👋 Hi, I’m @LilliDarling
- 👀 I’m interested in way too many things, like how to frustrate myself the most and have apparently landed on software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development through a program called Hack Reactor through Galvanize. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now but my skills in Python are becoming more solidified and hopefully Javascript to follow suite.
- 📫 How to reach me ... don't. Unless you're offering tacos. Then MAYBE you can reach me.

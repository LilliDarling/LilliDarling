- 👋 Hi, I’m @LilliDarling
- 👀 I’m interested in way too many things, like how to frustrate myself the most and have apparently landed on software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how not to punch my computer because I am on the struggle bus with learning React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... don't. Unless you're offering tacos. Then MAYBE you can reach me.

To be honest, I only started doing this because of my partner. I enjoy watching it come together and I am finding the pure satisfaction of making some code my bitch
after working on it for way too long only to realize I just needed to add the damn semicolon. Who knows, maybe I will become a software developer or maybe I will just 
learn everything I can about it and then use it to get world domination. In the meantime, you're more than welcome to follow my work! I promise it's nothing special.
